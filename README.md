# Afya Mobile version for Team-51X

## What is Afya?
Afya is a Computerized Medical Record, a digital health record that stores and secures your health information: treatments, test results, allergies...

It allows you to share them with the health professionals of your choice, who need them to treat you.

Afya's goal is to make available to healthcare professionals, with the patient's prior consent, medical information (medical history, laboratory test results, imaging, current treatments) from other healthcare professionals (general practitioners, specialists, nursing or hospital staff) defining a medical profile of each patient.

## What does Afya contain?
Afya contains :

- The patient's medical history,
- Medications prescribed and administered,
- Hospitalization reports and other test results (medical analyses, x-rays, etc.),
- Contact information for relatives to be contacted, if necessary.

All of this information is digitized and shared with healthcare professionals to ensure better patient care, thanks to improved coordination and continuity of care.

## How does Afya work?
Afya is a computerized medical record, fed by healthcare professionals. All the information in the file is therefore "personal and confidential" and is subject to medical confidentiality. The patient has full control over the data that is shared, i.e. he can choose not to disclose it to certain practitioners. Only the patient's treating physician has access to all information. In an emergency, health care professionals may exceptionally have access to the patient's Afya file.
